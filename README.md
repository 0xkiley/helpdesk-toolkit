# 💼 Helpdesk Toolkit

This repo is a personal collection of real-world helpdesk tasks, scripts, and notes.  
It's part documentation, part learning journal — built to track my growth as I move from IT support into system administration and beyond.

## 🧠 Purpose

**Why this exists:**  
When you're working helpdesk, you're constantly solving problems — but unless you document what you learn, it's easy to forget it. This repo is my way of:

- Logging useful commands, scripts, and walkthroughs I’ve used in production
- Building a personal reference I can reuse and improve over time
- Creating a trail of practical experience as I grow in IT

Whether it's setting up shared mailboxes in Azure or automating user management, this repo keeps it all in one place.
